# Risk Return Analysis, Whale Funds & S&P 500

---

This is a Jupyter Lab via command line interface created code used with the assitance of Pandas to create an analysis of DataSets that compared 4 large hedgefunds to the S&P 500 index to determine if their risk was worth the return compared to the 'market'. This project contains visualizations of the different risk profiles of the hedge funds Soros Fund Management LLC, Pauson & Co. INC, Tiger Global Management LLC, Berkshire Hathaway INC, as well as the S&P 500. The goal was to determine which fund(s) would best compliment a portfolio depending on it's risk/return over the past 5 years.
